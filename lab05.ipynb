    "\n",
    "_Data and original analysis from [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou/wiki-pageview-notebook), adapted with added analysis by Chris Pyles_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll cover the basics of one of the most important aspects of data science: data visualization. By this point, you should have some familarity with data visualization from the builtin `Table` methods that allow you to create plots, histograms, and the like, but today we'll cover the tool that underlies all of those: `pyplot`. The `pyplot` library, a subset of a larger plotting library called `matplotlib`, is a very powerful (if unintiuitive) tool that allows you to create robust data visualizations in Python. While there are some other tools that can be used in conjunction with `pyplot` and which make the code easier to write and understand (e.g. `seaborn`, `altair`), we won't be covering those in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before you continue in this lab, please take time to complete the [`pyplot` tutorial](pyplot.ipynb).** This will give you the basic building blocks to understand how to answer the questions in this lab. If you find yourself struggling with a plot, post on Piazza or _Google the function_. We cannot stress enough how helpful this is. For example, if you didn't know how to choose where the $x$ ticks fall on a scatter plot, you should start by googling \"pyplot xticks\" and go from there."

If you're interested, the code that was used to generate the data sets loaded below and the original analysis are hosted [on Github](https://github.com/staeiou/wiki-pageview-notebook). The `house` and `senate` tables below contain one column for each member of the House and Senate, respectively, and one row for each month from January 2016 to December 2018.
